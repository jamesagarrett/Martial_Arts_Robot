# Martial Arts Robot
## Introduction
A maneuverable, robotic machine that uses LIDAR detection to autonomously navigate its environment. This machine is controlled through a Raspberry Pi and is designed to simulate martial arts sparring for users who want a dynamic training experience when unaccompanied by another human opponent. Built to support the weight of a punching bag, the robot navigates its surroundings while also keeping track of its user's position and maintaining a close but safe distance from them at all times.
## Robot Features
**Raspberry Pi 4.0:** Single-board computer used for code execution  
**Slamtec RPLIDAR A1:** 360Â° distancing detection sensor used for analyzing robot surroundings  
**Omni-directional Wheels (3):** Specialized wheels used for linear movement in any and all desired directions  
**Jaguar Motor Controllers (3):** PWM speed controllers used to specify output current for the wheels  
**Adafruit 16-Channel 12-Bit PWM/Servo Driver:** Breakout board connected to the Pi used to output PWM signals to the motor controllers 
## Program Details  
This program is split into modules, all contributing to three primary tasks:  
1. Sensor data collection and analysis
2. Optimal angle and distance maneuvering calculations
3. Repositioning of the robot to its new, desired location  

Module Functionality:  
* **PCA9685.py:** Created by Adafruit as a tool for communicating with the 16-Channel PWM Driver
* **Adafruit_rplidar.py:** Created by Adafruit as a tool for retrieving raw data from the Slamtec RPLIDAR sensor  
* **globals.py:** Constant declarations that are used throughout other modules
* **helperFunctions.py:** A single location for frequent data calculations that are utilized in more than one module
* **lidarAnalysis.py:** Contains main() and is where LIDAR sensor data is collected and analyzed to see if the robot should reposition itself
* **maneuverAnalysis.py:** Determines the best angle and distance to move at in order to be a safe distance from the user and any environmental obstacles
* **repositionMachine.py:** Gives output to the wheels, moving the robot to the desired position  
# Video Demos
